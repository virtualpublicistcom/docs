## Manual Control or AI Speed? You Decide

Every creator works differently. Some prefer control over every detail, while others just want speed and simplicity.  
**Virtual Publicist gives you both options:**

### 1. Manual Mode: Custom Campaigns, Step by Step

Do you like being hands-on? Then manual mode is just for you!  
Here’s what you can do:

- **Pick Your Campaign Type** – Choose from different goals like promoting a product, securing playlist placement, etc.  
- **Select Your Contacts** – Use AI to suggest the right people to reach out to, or upload your own contact list.  
- **Write Your Message** – Draft your own outreach message or let AI give you a starting point.  
- **Attach a Press Release** – Add a press release to give your contacts more context and detail.  
- **Edit and Save** – Rearrange, reset, or keep shaping your draft until it’s ready to go live.  

This mode is ideal for anyone who wants full creative control while still getting a little help from AI when needed.

### 2. AI Agent: Quick, Polished Campaigns in Minutes

Don’t have the time to refine every detail? Then the **AI Agent** comes forward to do the heavy lifting for you!  
All you need is a simple prompt — like:

> “PR campaign for new single release to playlist curators and music blogs.”

…and it builds the campaign suitable for you.

With **AI Agent mode**, you can:

- Generate a full draft based on your input.  
- Build outreach lists for media and curators.  
- Create campaigns designed for platforms like YouTube.  

It’s the fastest way to launch a high-quality campaign without spending hours on setup.
