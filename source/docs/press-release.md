## Two Ways to Write: Manual Mode vs. AI Agent

Every creator, entrepreneur, and brand has their own style. Virtual Publicist meets you there with two modes designed to fit your workflow.

### 1) Manual Mode — For Hands-On Creators

If you like shaping every detail yourself, manual mode is your playground. You can:

- Craft **headlines** and write your **text from scratch**  
- **Generate sections** of text with built-in tools  
- **Add or remove** paragraphs and images as you go  
- **Rearrange** content with ease  
- **Reset** the text if you want a fresh start  
- **Schedule** a release date so your news goes live at the perfect time  
- **Save** your work and refine until it feels complete  
- **Upload a cover image** to make your announcement stand out

> Think of manual mode as your **digital press room** — it gives you the structure, but **you hold the pen**.

### 2) AI Agent — For Speed & Simplicity

When time is short or inspiration is running low, the AI agent steps in like your personal PR assistant. With a single prompt, it can:

- Generate **complete, SEO-friendly** press release text in minutes  
- Suggest **headlines** that grab attention  
- Build **targeted media outreach lists** so you know exactly who to contact  
- Prepare materials for **YouTube videos**, turning your news into multimedia campaigns

> With AI agent mode, you don’t just save time — you gain confidence knowing your press release is crafted with **expert-level quality**.

**Watch & Learn:** Add your training videos or links here (format not supported in docs, but can be embedded in the post).

## Why This Matters

Press releases remain one of the **most powerful** tools in PR. They help you share news, build credibility, and get coverage.

- **Simple tools** mean no more hours wasted on formatting.  
- **AI support** ensures you never run out of fresh ideas and angles.  
- **Scheduling options** keep you organized and on time.

### A Quick Scenario

You’re an independent artist about to release a new single. Between rehearsals, mixing, and visuals, writing a press release feels overwhelming.

- **Manual Mode:** Draft your headline — _“Rising Star Drops Bold New Single This Fall.”_ Add track details, upload cover art, and schedule for launch day.  
- **AI Agent:** Type a prompt — _“Press release for a new hip-hop single launching October 15.”_ In minutes, you get a complete draft, suggested media contacts, and ideas for a YouTube promo.

> Instead of stressing, you’re back to focusing on your art. That’s the power of **Virtual Publicist**.
